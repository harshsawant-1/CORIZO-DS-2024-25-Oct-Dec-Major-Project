In this capstone project, we aim to develop a predictive classification model for yield analysis in a semiconductor manufacturing process. The modern semiconductor manufacturing industry relies heavily on real-time monitoring via sensor signals. However, not all collected signals contribute meaningfully to understandingandimprovingproduction yield.
